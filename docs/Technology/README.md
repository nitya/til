# TIL : Technology

This section collects articles related to working with a specific technology or product (think proper nouns) like _Docsify_, _Node_, _JavaScript_ etc. and then organizing the subfolders within that skill in the manner that makes most sense to that context. If technology is about a broad category (e.g., Web Development), create that as a subfolder under the `Topic` top-level category and have that README link to any relevant `Technology` pages in it's index page.
