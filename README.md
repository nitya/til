# 🙌🏽  Today I Learned

Inspired by [this](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) project. Also to create a trail of breadcrumbs for revisiting my own learnings on demand.

> Process

| | |
|:---|:---|
| ✍🏽  | Write concise and action-oriented articles (what, why, how) on small things learned each day in tech and life. |
| 🎯 | Aim to learn one new thing a day |
| 🏷 | Categorize by Technology (proper noun e.g., Scratch), Topic (common noun e.g., Accessibility) and Skill (verb e.g., Sketchnoting, Cooking) for simplicity
| 📜 | Configure with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) to get automatically-built & hosted GitHub pages with time-stamped posts ftw | 
| | |

> Docsify Setup

Thought I'd be a bit meta and create a `Docsify` category (under Technology) and write a `Setup GitHub Pages Blog` article that describes how I set this up - as my first TIL contribution!

🎉 Let's do this!
